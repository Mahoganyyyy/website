                <hr>
                <p>Since February 2019, I have been working as a Software Developer for <a href="http://www.mandon.co.uk" target="blank">Mandon Software</a> in Romford. From February 2019 to March 2020, I was enrolled on a Level 3 Software Development apprenticeship,
                    which I successfully completed. </p>
                <p>When I joined, I had no experience in development, except some work at school. Since I joined, I have become an integral part of a small team working on a Front-End rebuild of a powerful Insurance Broker Software used by companies spanning
                    3 continents. </p>
                <p>I use the technologies and skills listed below to create front end screens that perform a wide variety of functions. Some screens are basic data represenation and entry screens, however some are more complex and have to carry out complex
                    functions such as document production, file management, file uploading and retrieval, and any functionality our clients request.</p>

                        <p>I work with C# and the .NET Framework every day for our MVC based web application. I write complex procedures mainly to format large pieces of data before sending said data into the view. I can create well structured classes and
                            models to perform a wide variety of operations.

                        <p>I use JavaScript in the views of our web app to perform any function needed on the web page. This is usually done in conjuction with jQuery and Kendo to alter the functionality of widgets, since some needed functionality is not
                            supported out of the box by Kendo.

                        <span class="title"><b>jQuery</b></span>
                        <p>Although I am aware of new technologies replacing jQuery, it was essential for me to learn this technology since Kendo UI is based on it. I have learned jQuery to an intermediate level, and use it to construct Kendo UI widgets,
                            and to collect data from forms.

                        <p>I use Bootstrap whenever needed to create fully responsive forms. A large part of our web app is data entry and processing, so it is vital to have nice looking, well structured forms. I also created the navigation system for the
                            web app using Bootstrap's navbar feature.

                        <p><a href="https://www.telerik.com/kendo-jquery-ui" target="blank">Kendo UI</a> is a diverse front end framework that I use extensively at work. The web app has to display lots of data, so I utilise the grid widget to achieve this.
                            I have also used other features, such as Date Pickers, Dropdowns, PDF viewers, and many more.

                            are more complex and deal with larger files and images.

                            Recently I have been working on a Xamarin Forms application for one of our clients that serves as a dashboard portal to all of their other software. Whilst being simple, developing this app has given me a foundation level of knowledge on using Xamarin
                            forms to develop cross-platform applications.

                                <p>This apprenticeship required me to completed a wide variety of projects based around my work on the job. It also required me to complete a synoptic project to prove my skills, about which I recieved very positive feedback
                                    from the examiner. You can see the repository <a href="https://github.com/Mahoganyyyy/MazeGame" target="blank">here.</a></p>

                                <p>Although I haven't travelled much, it is something I love doing. I went to Vienna in 2019 with my Girlfriend, and had trips to New York, Munich, and Toronto booked for 2020. These had to be cancelled due to Covid-19.</p>
